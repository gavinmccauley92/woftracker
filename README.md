An attempt to catalogue statistics on Wheel of Fortune episodes.

Code in the "record" folder is obsolete; I began by making a huge GUI interface to slowly input data one action at a time. As I learned more CS concepts, I was able to more masterfully parse text files and do all the analyzing from there, leading to the "readout" folder.

Analyses themselves are at https://woftracker.wordpress.com
